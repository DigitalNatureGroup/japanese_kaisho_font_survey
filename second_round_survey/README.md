# Details
After the screening in the first round survey, the second round survey was conducted to evaluate 27 fonts more precisely. All participants are Dan holders collected from social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and the contact list of the author asked to answer the evaluation of 27 fonts at google forms online. The evaluation required the judgment for each font, where the evaluation used a five-level Likert scale (1: Bad, 2: Slightly bad, 3: Normal, 4: Slightly good, and 5: Good) based on the seven perspectives (1: Overall rating, 2: brush-stokes for handling a brush, 3: Shape of the character, 4: Balance of the character, 5: Momentum, 6: Dynamism, 7: Stretched), where the 2-7th perspectives are evidenced from the Paper Scoring Criterion - referenced Evaluation from Criticism for Calligraphy Works by Miyaji.
