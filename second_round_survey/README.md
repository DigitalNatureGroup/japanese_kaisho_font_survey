Regarding the 27 kaisho fonts selected in the First round survey, 10 Dan-holders (P1-P10) gave a 5-step evaluation for a total of 7 items from 6 perspectives and overall evaluation.

# Details
After the screening in the first round survey, the second round survey was conducted to evaluate 27 fonts more precisely. All participants are Dan holders collected from social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and the contact list of the author asked to answer the evaluation of 27 fonts at google forms online. The evaluation required the judgment for each font, where the evaluation used a five-level Likert scale (1: Bad, 2: Slightly bad, 3: Normal, 4: Slightly good, and 5: Good) based on the seven perspectives (1: Overall rating, 2: brush-stokes for handling a brush, 3: Shape of the character, 4: Balance of the character, 5: Momentum, 6: Dynamism, 7: Stretched), where the 2-7th perspectives are evidenced from the Paper Scoring Criterion - referenced Evaluation from Criticism for Calligraphy Works by Miyaji.

# Note
### Where can I check the correspondence between the font ID and the actual font images in the Second survey?
We apologize for the inconvenience, but checking the correspondence between the font ID and the actual font images in the Second survey can be a bit troublesome. This is due to the fact that the same font name has different IDs in the First survey and the Second survey.
1. To find out the font name of the font you are interested in, please refer to the correspondence table for the First survey font ID, font name, and font image [available here](https://github.com/DigitalNatureGroup/japanese_kaisho_font_survey/tree/main/first_round_survey#wabun_font_library_kaisho1jpg-wabun_font_library_kaisho2jpg'ï¼‰.
2. From the second_round_correspondence_between_fontID_font_name.csv, you can find the target font name and the font ID in the Second survey.
3. With this information, you will be able to convert between "actual font images <-> font name <-> font ID in the Second survey <-> survey results in the Second survey."
