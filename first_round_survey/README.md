# Details
99 Kaisho fonts sample are collected from an online website called The Japanese Font library for macOS and Windows [31]. For screening purposes, the first survey was conducted to select Kaisho fonts which are used as positive and negative examples. Participants collected from social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) were asked to answer the evaluation of 99 fonts at google forms online. The evaluation required a single five-level judgment for each font, where the evaluation used a five-level Likert scale (1: Bad, 2: Slightly bad, 3: Normal, 4: Slightly good, and 5: Good) based on the question of "How much do you want to use the designated font as the model when you practice Kaisho on the brush?".
